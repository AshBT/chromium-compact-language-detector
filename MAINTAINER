C++ library versionning
=======================

Public API version
------------------

When the versionning changes, modify the following lines in the file `configure.ac`:
AC_INIT([libcld], [0.1], [lucene@mikemccandless.com], [compact-language-detector], [http://code.google.com/p/chromium-compact-language-detector/])
AC_SUBST([CLD_API_VERSION], [0.1])

Libtool version
---------------

Libtool has a particular versionning, not meant for human usage, but for automatic library management in the system.
You must change the version at every public release of the library where anything changed in the source code, even when this is only a
revision change with only minor cosmetic changes, and no real usage effects. But update only for a release.
Hence libtool and public version are not meant to be following each other at all and are fully independent.

For details: http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html

Line to modify in `configure.ac`:
AC_SUBST([CLD_LT_VERSION], [0:0:0])

Makefile Targets
================

- make dist: generates compact-language-detector-0.1.tar.gz (0.1 will be replaced public version you set earlier).

- make distcheck: same as make dist but will try a fake distribution installation in a temporary folder to verify that nothing will be
  installed.

- make pkg-deb: creates a library (only dynamic) package and a -dev (with headers) packages under release/.

- make release: implies both distcheck and pkg-deb and move everything under release/ (you will hence find there 2 .deb and 1 .tar.gz).

TODO: make pkg-rpm, pkg-ebuild, API doc.

Release Process
---------------

Simply run: `make release`, then test the .deb by installing them and trying them.
